# DownscaledClimateData
Scripts to process, aggregate, and analyze downscaled climate modeling data for [Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI)](https://wicci.wisc.edu/). The raw downscaled climate data is available at [https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-uwpd-cmip5/](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-uwpd-cmip5/).

# Enviroments
Code is written in Python using verion 3.8.12 in Jupyter Notebooks. Scripts require the following libraries:
* numpy

Note that these scripts require a significant amount of RAM (>=48GB) to run.
